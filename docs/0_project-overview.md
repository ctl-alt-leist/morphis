# Morphis Project Overview

A unified mathematical framework for geometric computation.

## Name

From Greek *morphe* (form)—embodying the transformation and adaptation of geometric structures across different contexts while preserving their essential nature.

## Scope

Morphis provides tools for working with geometric algebra across mathematics and physics:

- **Elements**: Vectors (k-vectors), multivectors, frames, metrics
- **Operations**: Products, norms, projections, duality, exponentials
- **Transforms**: Rotors, translators, motors, PGA
- **Visuals**: 3D rendering, animation, 4D projection

The package provides mathematical tools. Applications live in examples.
